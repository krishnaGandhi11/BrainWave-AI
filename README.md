Introducing Brain Wave AI – My First AI & Full-Stack Web Project! 🚀
Excited to showcase Brain Wave AI, a web-based project that integrates Gemini's API for data fetching. This project marks several firsts for me:
 ✅ First AI-powered project 🤖
 ✅ First time using React.js for frontend development ⚛️
 ✅ First experience with MongoDB for backend storage 🗄️
I had the amazing opportunity to present this project at my college's National Science Day with my team member Mohit Mallick, where I demonstrated how AI-driven applications can enhance user interactions and provide intelligent insights.
Brain Wave AI works in real time! It showcases:
 🔹 User-friendly interface built with React.js
 🔹 Efficient data handling with MongoDB
 🔹 AI integration using Gemini’s API
📌 Tech Stack: React.js | MongoDB | Express.js | Node.js | Gemini API
